# headhunter.nvim

A Neovim plugin that helps you quickly **navigate and resolve merge conflicts** with customizable keybindings.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Jump directly to the **next or previous conflict** in your repository.
- Quickly resolve conflicts using simple keybindings:
  - **Take HEAD** (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) â€“ keeps your local changes.
  - **Take origin** (`>>>>>>> ...`) â€“ keeps the incoming changes.
  - **Take both** â€“ keeps both changes, concatenated in order.
- Minimal and fast â€” pure Lua implementation with no external dependencies.
- Fully customizable keybindings to fit your workflow.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "StackInTheWild/headhunter.nvim",
}
```

---

### Default Keymaps

Headhunter configures the following mappings automatically:

- `[g` â†’ Previous conflict (`:HeadhunterPrevious`)
- `]g` â†’ Next conflict (`:HeadhunterNext`)
- `<leader>gh` â†’ Take HEAD (`:HeadhunterTakeHead`)
- `<leader>go` â†’ Take origin (`:HeadhunterTakeOrigin`)
- `<leader>gb` â†’ Take both (`:HeadhunterTakeBoth`)
- `<leader>gq` â†’ List conflicts in the quickfix window (`:HeadhunterQuickfix`)

Override a key by setting it in `opts.keymaps` or disable it by setting it to `{}`.

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Assuming you are using the keybindings from above:

### Navigate Conflicts

- `[g` â†’ Jump to the previous conflict.
- `]g` â†’ Jump to the next conflict.

### Resolve Conflicts

Given a conflict block like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
my changes
=======
their changes
>>>>>>> branch
```

| Action      | Keybinding   | Command                 | Resulting Text in Buffer        |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Take HEAD   | `<leader>gh` | `:HeadhunterTakeHead`   | `my changes`                    |
| Take origin | `<leader>go` | `:HeadhunterTakeOrigin` | `their changes`                 |
| Take both   | `<leader>gb` | `:HeadhunterTakeBoth`   | `my changes`<br>`their changes` |

_Notes:_

- Take HEAD keeps only your local changes.
- Take origin keeps only the incoming changes from the other branch.
- Take both concatenates your changes with the incoming changes, in that order.
